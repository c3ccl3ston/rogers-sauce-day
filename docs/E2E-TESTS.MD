## Review test strategy

[Let's review our testing gaps](TEST-STRATEGY.MD)

## Covering business risk

We can use **functional, E2E UI** tests to cover some of the risks

## 🏋️‍♀️Write tests using best practices

1. Go to `com.saucedemo.exercises.E2ETests.java` and finish all of the tests.
2. Run each test to make sure they work
3. At the end, run all tests with `mvn test -Dtest=E2ETests`

❌ &nbsp; Don't create any new code, simply reuse existing code
